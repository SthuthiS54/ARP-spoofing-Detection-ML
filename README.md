# ARP-spoofing-Detection-ML

## Objective
This project implements an ARP Spoof Detection system using a deep learning approach based on LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks. The model is designed to identify malicious ARP spoofing attacks by analyzing network traffic patterns.

## Features

* LSTM-based ML Model: Detects ARP spoofing attacks with high accuracy.
* Packet Analysis with Wireshark: Captures and inspects network packets to identify anomalies.
* Dockerized Environment: Uses Docker containers with Ubuntu images for controlled ARP spoofing experiments.
* Accuracy: Achieves 98.89% accuracy in detecting ARP spoofing attacks.
